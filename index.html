        <h1>Education: Butterflies and Moths</h1>
        <p>Butterflies and moths belong to the order Lepidoptera, one of the major groups of insects.Butterflies and moths are simlar yet different. Butterflies are active in the day but moths are active at night, though some species of moths also come out at daytime. Moths usually have drab colours but some moths such as the Rosy Maple moth, is actually quite colourful. Its pink-and-yellow wings are a stunning sight! The colour that stands out the most though, is from the Madagascaran Sunset Moth! They sport rainbow coloured stripes, but I hate to say it, its all an illusion. You see, when light reflects on the wings, it appears rainbow. Otherwise, the moth is plain black. Butterflies are more attractive with brighter colors, although some are not. The Autumn Leaf butterfly has a leaflike appearance with drab colours. Also some butterflies like the Evening Brown tend to be active during dawn and dusk, usually the times when moths are active. Let us mantain the great diversity around us for many years to come. Some of Singapore's butterflies are on the risk of extinction. Let's do our part by saving paper so that there are enough trees to maintain the diversity of butterflies. In Singapore, the butterflies are going extinct because of shortage of host plants. I hope all of you can do some research and put these plants in your gardens and balconies like what I have done. Bye!   </p>
